      <div class="panel-heading">Lesson 04 - Conditionals: use of <code>if</code> and comparisons</div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          In this lesson we will learn two important aspects of conditionals:<br/>
          <ul>
              <li>command <b>if</b>: it allows the computer to behave differently depending on a condition</li>
              <li><b>comparisons</b>: the different types of comparisons that we can use</li>
          </ul>
       </div>       
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel panel-success">
      <div class="panel-heading">Command <code>if</code></div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          Now things are getting interesting! The conditional <code>if</code> is certainly one of the most important things in coding. It adds flavor to your code! In order
          to use it we will also need to understand the comparisons, which is next in this lesson.<br/>
          <br/>
          The <code>if</code> commands needs a condition (for example, if the age is equals to 10) and then a set of instructions. Take a look at the code below:<br/>
 <pre><code>variables
  age
begin
  print("What's your age (in years)? ")
  read(age)

  println("You age is ", age)

  if (age == 10)
    println("Nice! I also have the same age")
  end
end</code></pre>   
          In TwinCoder the comparison equals is written as <code>==</code> (and so it is with many other coding languages such as Java, C, Python. etc). It requires the two equals instead of one, 
          to differentiate from the attribution (<code>age=10</code> sets 10 to age, but <code>age==10</code> compares the age to see if it is 10).<br/>
          <br/>
          Another important concept is the <code>else</code> block. That block indicates what to do if the condition is not met. Take a look at the following example:<br/>
 <pre><code>variables
  birthYear
begin
  print("What year were you born? ")
  read(birthYear)

  if (year == 2008)
    println("Wow! You were born in the same year as me!")
    println("That means that we are both 10 years old.")
  else
    println("Nice, you are ", 2018 - year, " years old")
  end
end</code></pre>    
          Try the code above and try to enter different birth years to check the results. Can you explain what is happening?
       </div>       
    </div> 
    
   <div class="panel panel-warning">
      <div class="panel-heading">Comparisons</div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          There are multiple comparisons that you can use with the command <code>if</code>. Plese take a look at the table below:<br/>
          
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Operator</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                  <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>==</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is equals to the other</td>
                  <td><code>age==10</code>, an age of 8, 9, 11 will be false, but 10 will be true</td>
                </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td><code>!=</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is different than the other</td>
                  <td><code>age!=10</code>, an age of 8, 9, 11 will be true, but 10 will be false</td>
                </tr>                
                <tr>
                  <td><code>&gt;</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is great than the other</td>
                  <td><code>age&gt;10</code>, an age of 8, 9, 10 will be false, but 11, 12 will be true</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>&gt;=</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is great or equals than the other</td>
                  <td><code>age&gt;=10</code>, an age of 8, 9 will be false, but 10, 11, 12 will be true</td>
                </tr>                
                <tr>
                  <td><code>&lt;</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is less than the other</td>
                  <td><code>age&lt;10</code>, an age of 8, 9 will be true, but 10, 11, 12 will be false</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>&lt;=</code></td>
                  <td>Compares if one side is less or equals than the other</td>
                  <td><code>age&lt;=10</code>, an age of 8, 9, 10 will be true, but 11, 12 will be false</td>
                </tr>                
              </tbody>
            </table>
          
              
          Now that we now the different types of comparison let's try the following:<br/>
 <pre><code>variables
  siblings
begin
  print("How many siblings do you have? ")
  read(siblings)

  if (siblings == 3)
     println("I have 3 siblings too!")
  end

  if (siblings < 3)
     println("I have more siblings than you.")
  end

  if (siblings > 3)
     println("You have more siblings than me. Oh boy!")
  end
end</code></pre>            
          Try it yourself! Run the program above more than once and try it with a different number of siblings.

      <div class="panel-heading">Exercises</div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          Now it is time to practice what we've learned. Below are some nice exercises!<br/>
          <ol>
              <li>Create a program that asks to guess your age, if it matches display a congratulation message, otherwise display that unfortunately the answer is wrong.</li>
              <li>Combine what you've learned so far with <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>. Use <code>println</code> and <code>speak</code>.</li>
              <li>Create a test for a student! Ask a question, for example ask what's the area of a square of a side of 9, and tell the student if he is right or wrong.</li>
          </ol>
          Have fun!
