      <div class="panel-heading">Lesson 03 - Use of <code>read</code> and <code>speak</code></div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          Hi, in this lesson we will learn how to use two important commands:<br/>
          <ul>
              <li><b>read</b>: reads from the keyboard</li>
              <li><b>speak</b>: makes the computer speak a text</li>              
          </ul>
          We will also use the commands we've learnt in past lessons.
      </div>
    </div>  
      
    <div class="panel panel-success">
      <div class="panel-heading">Command <code>read</code></div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          In the previous lesson we learned how to use <i>variables</i>. We simply defined the variables and set a value for it
          so that we could use it. With the <code>read</code> command we will ask the person using the computer to enter the value
          and we will store it in a variable. Check the code below:
 <pre><code>variables
  firstName, lastName
begin
  print("What's your first name?")
  read(firstName)
  print("What's your last name?")
  read(lastName)

  println("Hi ", firstName, " ", lastName, " it is a pleasure to meet you!")
  println("Your last name ", lastName, " is very familiar, is your family from Westchester too?")
end</code></pre>      
         Notice that in the code above, we are asking the person that's using our program to enter her/his first name and last name. Later, we will print 
         to the screen both first name and last name combined, and mention how familiar his last name is. Try it yourself! <br/>
         <br/>
         We can use <code>read</code> to ask for number and afterwards do some calculations. Check it out:
 <pre><code>variables
  sideA, sideB, area
begin
  print("What's the first side of the rectangle?")
  read(sideA)
  print("What's the other side of the rectangle?")
  read(sideB)

  area = sideA * sideB
  
  println("The area of the rectangle is ", area)
end</code></pre>         
         The command <code>read</code> is one of the most important commands and you will use it in many occasions. Make sure you practice and you understand how it works.            
    </div>       
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="panel panel-warning">
      <div class="panel-heading">Command <code>speak</code></div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          The command <code>speak</code> is not the most important command you need to learn, but it is really fun. It is a very simple one
          that we can use to make the computer speak! Check the code below:
 <pre><code>
begin
  speak("Hello World!")
end</code></pre>      
          Now you are familiar with the "Hello World" classic example. You can also use speak just like print and println, passing multiple parameters. Like this:<br/>
 <pre><code>variables
  age
begin
  age = 10
  speak("My age is ", age, " years old")
end</code></pre>            
          Try it yourself! <br/>
         <br/>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">Important</div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you have your sound on, otherwise you will not hear the computer speak and it will look like nothing happened.</li>
                        <li>Be careful to not disturb other people next to you, you can use a headphone while you are practicing</li>
                        <li>Be respectful and do not attempt to make the computer say bad words, remember that others might be listening</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </div>
            </div>
         
    </div>       
    </div>    

    <div class="panel panel-danger">
      <div class="panel-heading">Exercises</div>

      <div class="panel-body">
          Now it is time to practice what we've learned. Below are some nice exercises!<br/>
          <ol>
              <li>Create a program that asks how many pizzas the customer wants and prints to the screen the total (each of our pizzas is 14 dollars)</li>
              <li>Create a program that asks for the side of a square, and calculates the area and the perimeter</li>
              <li>Modify the programs above so that the computer speaks the total of the pizzas, the area and the perimeter of the square</li>
          </ol>
          
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">Math tip</div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    I know you are an ace in math and don't need help, but other fellow students might not remember and it is required for the exercises above, so here it goes:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The area of the square is the side times itself (<code>area = side * side</code>), i.e. the square of the side</li>
                        <li>The perimeter of the square is the side times 4 (<code>area = 4 * side</code> or <code>area = side + side + side + side</code>)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
